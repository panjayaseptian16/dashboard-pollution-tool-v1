            **Comparison 1: During Policy vs. Before Policy (Same Year)**
            - **Same-year conditions:** Control for external factors, ensuring a direct policy impact comparison.
            - **Two months before policy:** Crucial, given historical high AQI levels in June and July; cross-year analysis enhances effectiveness insights.
            - **Type I Error Control:** Apply Bonferroni correction for multiple test control.

            **Comparison 2: During Policy vs. Before Policy (Previous Year)**
            - **Previous-year conditions:** Consistency and control for year-specific variations.
            - **Two months before policy:** Establish baseline; consider historical trends.
            - **Type I Error Control:** Apply Bonferroni correction.

            Ensuring a robust analysis, considering within-year and cross-year perspectives, while controlling potential errors via Bonferroni correction.
